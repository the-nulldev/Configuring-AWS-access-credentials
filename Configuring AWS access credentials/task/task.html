<p>With the AWS CLI installed, it's time to set up your access credentials. One way you can achieve this is by creating an IAM user in the AWS console and generating access keys for them. For this task, do not assign any permissions to this user. Once your IAM user is in place, generate an access key pair and configure your CLI with the provided access key ID and secret access key. Alternatively, you can configure your credentials using session tokens or access keys from the AWS IAM Identity Center service.</p>

<p>After setting up your credentials and verifying that they work, head back to your IDE and hit the <em>Check</em> button.</p>

<p>[ALERT-warning] Remember to deactivate and delete these access keys and the IAM user when you are done with this task! [/ALERT]</p>
